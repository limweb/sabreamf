# SabreAMF #

SabreAMF is now **unmaintained**. The announcement can be read [on my blog](http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/blog/throwing-in-the-towel-with-sabreamf-and-dropbox-php-lib).

The sourcecode has been moved to [Github](https://github.com/evert/SabreAMF), where it can be freely forked. If somebody who cares enough steps up, I'll happily transfer control.

**Thanks to everyone for the support. I learned a ton, and hope this project has been useful to you in one way or another**
